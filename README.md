# Business Problem and Objective 
#MLTeam3 is a market leading reserach group focused on automative supply chain with data backed reporting and forecasting services for auto manufacturers, parts suppliers and dealership groups across the globe. #MLTeam3 provides AI backed market predictions and forecasts to optimize demand based decision making for all verticles in the industry. 

Business Problem:
A large dealership network is seeking to optimize their sales forecast and engaged #MLTeam3 to boost their inventory management by identifying best selling vehicles within their competitve markets. 

Objective:
#MLTeam3 will develop a Machine Learning model to predict the top 3 best sellers and aid the dealer's inventory decsions to ensure model avilablity for customers to purchase with the aim of increasing sales volume and driving profitability. 

# Note about the dataset
#MLTeam3 is leveraging the Car Sales Report data from Kaggle for training and testing the ML model. The base dataset contains sales data with over 2000 samples within 16 features. The dataset contains historical sales data for peroid of 24 months starting from Jan 1, 2022 and concluding by Dec 2023. The key features in the data are:

- Car_ID - A unique identifer for each car 
- Date - Date of the sale transaction 
- Customer Name - Name of the purchaser

## Syntetic Additoins
Along with the base dataset, we have chosen to include additional features to enhance the dataset focused on real-world metrics. After much consideration, we have chosen to add the following features:

- Family Size - Feature to capute the size of the purchasers family as that is a key buying consideration 
- Gas Milage - Fuel efficient is one of the top 5 decision factors when buying a vehicle 
- Crash Test Score - Along with fuel efficiency, safecty rating of a vehicle is a strong driver of purchasing decision
